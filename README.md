# Depression Detection Project

## Overview

Depression is a pervasive mental health condition characterized by persistent sadness and a loss of interest in pleasurable activities. This project addresses the global challenge posed by depression, with a specific focus on its impact in Saudi Arabia. A significant proportion of individuals in the country do not access adequate treatment due to prevailing social stigmas surrounding mental health. Recent advancements in mental health research, particularly in the domain of depression detection through textual data analysis, provide an opportunity to address this issue.

## Project Goals

- Unravel Historical Evolution: Explore the historical evolution of depression terminology to gain insights into its changing understanding over time.

- Highlight Global Prevalence: Shed light on the worldwide prevalence of depression and its implications for societies globally.

- Project Impact by 2030: Project the potential impact of depression on a global scale by the year 2030, emphasizing the urgency of addressing this mental health challenge.

- Methodologies Employed: Utilize diverse methodologies, including Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to identify depression indicators and showcase the versatility of these approaches.

- Focus on Arabic Text Analysis: Emphasize the reliability of Logistic Regression (LR) as a robust choice for analyzing Arabic text in the context of depression detection. Highlight its consistently high accuracy rates across various studies.

- Objective: Facilitate the identification of depression indicators in Arabic tweets on Twitter, aiming to enhance mental health support not only in Saudi Arabia but also on a broader scale.
